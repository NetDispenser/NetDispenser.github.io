Hello, I'd like to tell you about a tool for parents called the NetDispenser.

It is, perhaps, most easily understood by a familiar example.

Imagine that you are busy cooking dinner while your child is playing around online.

And imagine further that you wish that you could get your child to read a particular magazine article that you feel holds an important message for them, but for any number of reasons it's just not that easy.
</p><p>
The NetDispenser can make it easy.

Basically, it makes them earn their internet access so that they do what you ask <u>first</u>, before playing around online.

It turns things around so that rather than <u>you</u> asking them to occasionally do something constructive with their time, instead they ask <u>you</u>!
</p><p>
Actually, they don't even need to ask you, they can just "feed" themselves the educational content you have already arranged for them and spare you the direct involvement and micro-manageing that would have normally been necessary.

In this familiar scenario you can be sure that your child is reading diligently, and simply look forward to an interesting conversation at the dinner table about <u>what</u> they've been reading.
</p>

Here's how it works.

At the center of it all is a special router that becomes the internet access point at home for your child.

This "special router" could be any computer so long as it's configured a certain way.

The project uses the popular Raspberry Pi computer because it is simple, inexpensive and readily available. (amazon shopping cart with 3x pieces)
</p><p>
Here are the pieces both in and out of their packaging. The hard-drive of this computer is just a simple micro SD card, and the software on this SD card is what turns this simple computer into a powerful tool for parents.
</p><p>
The NetDispenser requires two WiFi interfaces -- one to talk to your home's main router and one to act as a HotSpot and broadcast the Credit-Meter webpage.

The device has one built-in WiFi interface, here.  The second WiFi interface is this little USB antenna which provides the HotSpot and serves the credit-meter's local website.
</p><p>
The credit-meter website has one page for parents and another for children.  When a child logs in they see what we call the Credit-Meter.  If the parent has enabled the Credit-Meter then the child can only reach certain whitelisted websites without using credits.  By default, the only whitelisted site is the online credit-earning website, which we call the "Credit-Feeder".
</p>

<hr/>
<p>

Let's pretend that you are the child and you only have 30 credits in your account.  At the default exchange rage thirty credits allows you to have 30 seconds of full internet access.  To use them just push the start button and the credit-meter will begin to consume your credits while granting full access to all  devices associated with your account.
</p><p>
After 30 seconds the credit-meter will stop running and you will only be able to access the online credit-feeder website.

So you visit the credit-feeder website to earn more credits by completing an activity which  your parent has arranged for you.  It's usually a good idea for parents to mark at least one activity as "repeatable" so that children can always have some way to feed themselves.  Math activities can be good candidates for this.  Geography activities are another.
</p><p>
But let's say you choose to earn credits by reading an article which has been pasted together for you.  Shown here is the original prototype activity of the NetDispenser.  First you read a complete paragraph, then you reconstruct the same paragraph before moving on.
</p><p>
When you are finished you get the credits.  You just need to transfer your credits back to the special router at home in order to use them.  This is easily done with a single button.  Now you can repeat the process and feed yourself as necessary when you need more time.
</p>

The interesting thing about the NetDispenser is that it serves as a single point of motivation, regardless of the activity or subject matter.  Kids want internet access. And this consistent motivating factor translates to a consistent effort, regardless of subject matter.  They'll work math problems, read about world history, study a foreign language or even make an effort towards things they don't understand at all.
</p><p>
It has a broad potential, and to realize its potential the project needs a diverse community of developers to contribute a variety of activities.  But where is the incentive for anyone to make such contributions?
</p><p>
The project aims to solve the "incentive problem" by creating an ecosystem around free education software that compensates developers and makes free education software development an attractive and viable pasttime.  Parents who utilize the credit-transfer functionality are asked to become subscribers, but they are also provided with an interface to distribute 100% of their subscription fee to the developers of their choice.
</p><p>
This arrangement can increase communication between users and developers and result in fine-tuned activities with increased effectiveness.  And by providing a tangible incentive it can stimulate new innovations from a greater number of contributors.  The system also has potential as a research tool and for use in schools.  All of this is an experiment, and this experiment needs you.  Whether you are a parent of a developer, please join us!  Together we can help build great things.
