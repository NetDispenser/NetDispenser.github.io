Hello, I'd like to tell you about a tool for parents called the NetDispenser.

Let me explain it by example:

You have a child; in addition to playing video games all night, you would like your child to do something constructive once in a while.

But you just don't have the time or energy to micro-manage them like that.
</p><p>
This is the NetDispenser, and it can literally do such dirty work for you.

Basically, it requires children to earn their internet access by completing educational tasks of your choosing.

It turns things around so that rather than <b>you</b> asking them to do something constructive, they ask <b>you</b> for the opportunity.

</p><p>
Actually, they don't even need to ask you, they can just "feed" themselves educational content that you've already arranged for them, sparing you from being the "bad guy".  Kids develop a bird-birdfeeder relationship with the system leaving you to simply enjoy the results.

Those results might be: global awareness, ability to focus or even more interesting conversations at the dinner table!
</p>

<p>

Here's how it works.

At the center of it all is a WiFi-kiosk that requires "credits" in order to access the internet.

This wifi-kiost could be any computer so long as it's configured a certain way.

Project "NetDispenser" uses the popular Raspberry Pi computer because it is simple, inexpensive and readily available.

</p><p>

The hard-drive of this computer is this little SD card, and the software on this SD card is what turns the device into a powerful tool for parents.

</p><p>

The device broadcasts a local webpage for configuration, but also what we call the credit-meter webpage, for kids.  When a child logs in they see what we call the Credit-Meter.  As the name suggests, the credit-meter requires credits in exchange for internet access.

</p><p>

These credits can be earned at the online, whitelisted "credit-feeder" website.

<hr/>
<p>

Let's pretend that you are the child and that you are about to run out of credits!  When this happens the internet shuts-off for all your devices, and you can only visit the whitelisted credit-feeder website, but here you can earn more credits and thus more internet access.

</p><p>

So you visit the credit-feeder website and complete an activity which your parent has arranged for you.
When you are finished you get some credits.  You just need to transfer your credits back to the credit-meter in order to use them.  Transferring credits is a one-click procedure.  Now you can repeat the process and feed yourself as necessary whenever you need more time.

</p>

<p>

An interesting thing about the NetDispenser is that it serves as a <b>single point of motivation</b>.
The motivation is internet access, and this consistent motivating factor translates to a <b>consistently strong effort</b> to get it, regardless of subject matter.  They'll work math problems, read about world history, study a foreign language or even things they don't understand ... realizing early-on that the easiest way to their goal is by making a sincere, focused effort.  You can lead a child to quality educational resources but making them <b>care</b> is not so easy.

</p><p>

Does caring about credits lead to the same depth of learning that occurs when they actually care about the work?  Experience says YES!

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
So the NetDispenser can be an effective tool for many subjects.
It has a broad potential, but to realize that potential it needs a broad range of activities contributed by a corresponding broad range of contributors.  But where is the incentive for anyone to make such contributions?
</p><p>
The project aims to solve the "incentive problem" by creating an ecosystem around free education software that compensates developers and makes free education software development an attractive and viable pasttime.  Parents with sufficient means are asked to become subscribers, and as a subscriber they are  provided with an interface to distribute 100% of their subscription fee to the developers of their choice.
So we're basically asking them to support their favorite activities and giving them an interface to distribute their support among several developers.
</p><p>
This arrangement can increase communication between users and developers and result in fine-tuned activities with increased effectiveness.  And by providing a tangible incentive it can stimulate new innovations from a greater number of contributors.  The system also has potential as a research tool and for use in schools.  All of this is an experiment, and this experiment needs you.  Whether you are a parent of a developer, please join us!  Together we can build great things.
