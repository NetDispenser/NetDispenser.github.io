Hello, I'd like to show you a new parenting tool called the NetDispenser.

Allow me explain it with an example:

Let's say that your child plays a lot of video games and that you would like your child to do something constructive once in a while, as well.

But you just don't have the time or energy for the micro-management that it would require.

</p><p>

This is the NetDispenser, and it can literally do the dirty work of micro-managing for you!

Basically, it requires children to earn their internet access by completing educational tasks of your choosing.

It turns things around so that rather than <b>you</b> asking them to do something constructive, they ask <b>you</b> for more math problems, or more things to read.

</p><p>

Actually, they don't even need to ask you, they can just "feed" themselves educational content that you've already arranged for them, sparing you from being the "bad guy" all the time.  Kids develop a bird-birdfeeder relationship with the system leaving you to simply enjoy the results.

Those results might be: global awareness, informed opinions, or interesting conversations when you sit down for dinner!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>

Here's how it works.

At the center is a wifi-kiosk that grants internet access in exchange for credits.

This could be any computer, but project "NetDispenser" uses the popular Raspberry Pi computer because it is simple, inexpensive and readily available.

</p><p>

The hard-drive of this computer is an SD card, and the software on the SD card is what turns the device into a powerful tool for parents.

</p><p>

The device broadcasts a webpage with the credit-meter application.

</p><p>

The credits can be awarded manually for mowing the lawn, or washing the dishes ...
but they can also be awarded automatically by the online, whitelisted "credit-feeder" website.

<hr/>
<p>

Let's pretend that you're the child and that you are about to run out of credits!  When this happens all of your devices lose their internet access, and the only place you can visit is the credit-feeder website in order to earn more credits.

</p><p>

So you visit the credit-feeder website and complete one of the activities that your mom or dad has arranged for you.  And when you are finished you get some credits.  It is a one-click procedure to transfer those credits from the credit-feeder website back to your account on the credit-meter.  You can repeat this process whenever you need to and thus keep yourself supplied with credits while you consume educational content, learn accountability, time management and develop a sense of shared ownership!

</p>

<hr/>
<p>

An interesting thing about the NetDispenser is that it works as a <b>single point of motivation</b>.
The consistent motive to earn credits translates to a consistent effort regardless of subject matter.
You can have your kids working math problems, reading about world history, studying a foreign language or even studying things they can't understand ... because they realize that the only way to reach their goal is to make a sincere and focused effort every time.

</p><p>

It's easy to lead a child to quality educational resources but it's difficult to make them <b>care</b>!

Does caring about earning credits lead to the same depth-of-learning that would naturally occur if they actually loved math or reading about world history?  Experience shows that the answer is yes!

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
So the NetDispenser can be an effective tool for many subjects.
But to realize its potential requires a broad range of activities from a broad range of contributors.
Not some handful of paid contributors, but anyone with good ideas for education.
Everyone has something to teach, and anyone can have good ideas.
But what incentive is there for anyone to contribute?
After all, developing an activity does take time and people can't work for free.
This is a fundamental problem that prevents a lot of people from developing free and opensource software.
It may be great for the world but working for free is hardly a viable career option.

</p><p>

The project aims to solve this "incentive problem" by creating an ecosystem around free software for education that compensates developers for making free software and makes free education software development an attractive and viable pasttime.  By "free" we mean licensed under a "free software license" such as the GPL, as well as "free to use" and "free to share".

</p><p>

So project NetDispenser asks that parents who can afford to become subscribers, do become subscribers, and as a subscriber they are provided with an interface to distribute 100% of their subscription fee to the developers of their choice.  So we're basically asking them to support their favorite activities and giving them an interface to distribute their support among the developers of their favorite activities.  This creates a flow of value in both directions which is the essential characteristic of a sustainable ecosystem.

</p><p>

This arrangement can increase communication between users and developers and result in ongoing improvements to activities to increase their effectiveness.  And, by providing a tangible incentive it can attract new contributors and thereby stimulate new innovations.

</p><p>

Project NetDispenser is an experiment that requires two communities: a community of parents and a community of developers.  So whether you are interested as a parent, a developer, or both, we hope that you'll see the value and the potential, and that you'll join us to help parents teach kids, and to build some high-quality, free-software for education.
