Hello, I'd like to show you a parenting tool called the NetDispenser.

Allow me explain it with an example:

You have a child; in addition to playing video games all night, you would like your child to do something constructive once in a while.

But you just don't have the time or energy for such micro-management.

</p><p>
This is the NetDispenser, and it can literally do such dirty work for you.

Basically, it requires children to earn their internet access by completing educational tasks of your choosing.

It turns things around so that rather than <b>you</b> asking them to do something constructive, they ask <b>you</b> for opportunities to do something constructive.

</p><p>
Actually, they don't even need to ask you, they can just "feed" themselves educational content that you've already arranged for them, sparing you from being the "bad guy".  Kids develop a bird-birdfeeder relationship with the system leaving you to simply enjoy the results.

Those results might be: global awareness, ability to focus, or interesting conversations at your dinner table!
</p>

Here's how it works.

At the center is a wifi-kiosk that consumes credits in exchange for internet access.

This wifi-kiosk could be any computer, but project "NetDispenser" uses the popular Raspberry Pi computer because it is simple, inexpensive and readily available.

</p><p>

The hard-drive of this computer is an SD card, and the software on the SD card is what turns the device into a powerful tool for parents.

</p><p>

The device broadcasts a local webpage with a credit-meter application.

</p><p>

You could give credits for mowing the lawn, or washing the dishes ...
OR they can be earned at the online, whitelisted "credit-feeder" edu-kiosk website.

<hr/>
<p>

Let's pretend that you are the child and that you are about to run out of credits!  When this happens the internet shuts-off for all your devices, and you can only visit the whitelisted credit-feeder website, but here you can earn more credits and thus more internet access.

</p><p>

So you visit the credit-feeder website and complete one of the activities your mom or dad has arranged for you.  When you are finished you get some credits.  You just need to transfer your new credits back to the credit-meter so you can use them.  Transferring credits is a one-click procedure.  So now you can repeat the process whenever you need more and feed yourself as necessary.

</p>

<p>

An interesting thing about the NetDispenser is that it serves as a <b>single point of motivation</b>.
The motivation is internet access, and this consistent motivating factor translates to a <b>consistently strong effort</b> to get it, regardless of subject matter.  They'll work math problems, read about world history, study a foreign language or even study things they can't understand ... realizing early-on that the only way to their goal is by making a sincere and focused effort.
</p><p>

You can lead a child to quality educational resources but it's a little more difficult to make them <b>care</b>!

Does caring about credits lead to the same depth of learning that occurs when they care about the activity?  Experience says YES!

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
So the NetDispenser can be an effective tool for many subjects.
It has a broad potential, but to realize that potential it needs a broad range of activities contributed by a corresponding broad range of contributors.  But where is the incentive for anyone to make such contributions?
</p><p>
The project aims to solve the "incentive problem" by creating an ecosystem around free education software that compensates developers and makes free education software development an attractive and viable pasttime.  Parents with sufficient means are asked to become subscribers, and as a subscriber they are  provided with an interface to distribute 100% of their subscription fee to the developers of their choice.
So we're basically asking them to support their favorite activities and giving them an interface to distribute their support among several developers.
</p><p>
This arrangement can increase communication between users and developers and result in fine-tuned activities with increased effectiveness.  And by providing a tangible incentive it can stimulate new innovations from a greater number of contributors.  The system also has potential as a research tool and for use in schools.
</p><p>
Project NetDispenser is an experiment, and the experiment needs two communities -- users and developers.  Whether you are a parent, a developer or both, we hope that you'll join us!  Together we can help parents and build some high-quality, free-software for education.
