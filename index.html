<h3>Edu-Kiosk: A Tool For Parents</h3>
<p>
	Hello, we'd like to introduce you to a new parenting tool.
	It's called the NetDispenser and it's basically an
	edu-kiosk that requires kids to earn their internet access
	by completing educational tasks chosen by the parent.
</p><p>
	Using the NetDispenser, parents can teach their kids
	without direct involvement and micro-managing, or being the
	"bad guy" all the time.  The NetDispenser does the dirty
	work, leaving parent-child relationships unscathed.
</p><p>
	Using the NetDispenser,
	kids can not only learn to feed themselves educational
	content like birds at a bird-feeder, they can also learn
	to make a strong effort when they work, because with a
	well-designed activity a strong effort is their only
	option to get back online.
</p><p>
	But the NetDispenser is just a tool. Parents can turn
	it "on" when they need it and "off" when they don't.
</p><p>
	Here's a quick look at how it works: At the center is a
	wifi-kiosk that grants internet access in exchange for
	credits. This becomes the new access point for the kids.
	It broadcasts a web application called the credit-meter.
</p><p>
	When credits run out the credit-meter revokes internet
	access to all sites except the online credit-feeder
	website, where they can visit to earn more credits.
	The credits they earn at the credit-feeder need to be
	transferred back to the credit-meter. This is just a
	one-click procedure, which they can repeat whenever
	they need to, thus keeping themselves supplied with
	credits while consuming educational content, learning
	accountability, time management and having a sense
	of shared ownership!
</p><p>
	The desire for internet access serves as a single point
	of motivation, which translates to a consistently strong
	effort no matter what the activity.  And experience has
	found that the depth-of-learning when motivated this way is
	the same as would naturally occur had they been satisfying
	their own curiosity.  In other words: they do care, it's
	just for different reasons, but the effect is the same!
</p><p>
	Because it provides a consistent and singular source of
	motivation, the NetDispenser has potential for teaching
	a variety of subjects. But to realize this potential it
	requires activities across a variety of subjects.  Where
	do these activities come from?
</p>
<h3>Free Edu-Software Incentivizer</h3>
<p>
	We see this as an opportunity to stimulate free software
	for education. By "free" we mean licensed under a free
	software license, such as the GPL, as well as free to
	use and free to share.
</p><p>
	Note: The following text is under revision.<br>
	But what incentive is there for anyone to contribute?
	After all, developing an activity does take time and people
	can't work for free. This is a fundamental problem that
	prevents a lot of people from developing free and opensource
	software on their own. It may be great for the world but
	working for free is hardly a viable career option.
</p><p>
	The project aims to solve this "incentive problem" by
	creating an ecosystem around free software for education
	that compensates developers for making free software and
	makes free education software development an attractive
	and viable pasttime.
</p><p>
	The project's solution is to ask that parents who can afford
	to become subscribers, do become subscribers, and as a subscriber
	they are provided with an interface to distribute 100% of their
	subscription fee to the developers of their choice.  So we're
	basically asking them to support their favorite activities and
	giving them an interface to distribute their support among the
	developers of their favorite activities.  This creates a flow
	of value in both directions which is the essential characteristic
	of a sustainable ecosystem.
</p><p>
	This arrangement can increase communication between users and
	developers and result in ongoing improvements to activities to
	increase their effectiveness.  And, by providing a tangible
	incentive it can attract new contributors and thereby stimulate
	new innovations.
</p><p>
	The time is right for this project. Parents want their children
	to be prepared for the future and the NetDispenser is a tool
	that can help them do that.  As far as free software for
	education, well, there's plenty of room for more, and there's
	a world of possibilities out there.
</p><p>
	This project needs two communities: a community of parents
	and a community of developers.  Whether you are a parent,
	a developer, or both, we hope that you'll see the value
	and the potential, and that you'll join us to help parents
	teach kids, and to build some high-quality, free-software
	for education.

<ol>
	<li>The NetDispenser is an inexpensive Raspberry-Pi computer, configured as a WiFi Hotspot and  credit-meter, which grants internet access in exchange for earned credits.
	<li>Credits are awarded by completing educational activities at the credit-feeder website, which is always accessible.
	<li>Earned credits are transferred from the credit-feeder website back to the credit-meter device simply by clicking a button on the webpage broadcast by the device.
	<li>A second button starts the credit-meter and grants full internet access to all of the child's devices.
	<li>When the credits run out it's back to the credit-feeder to earn more credits.
	<li>Because the credit-feeder website is online, parents can configure assignments and queue them from anywhere.
	<li>The device is easily turned "on" when it's needed, and "off" when it's not.  The intent is not to restrict access to information.  Rather, it is a tool for parents to help them prepare their children for the future.

		An ecosystem to stimulate creation of free education software.
		Educational web activities are fed from the self-serve <i>Credit-Feeder</i> website at right (3).
		The child sits behind a WiFi access point (1,2).  The access point is the kiosk used for gaining internet access with earned credits.
		It runs its own website with a <i>Credit-Meter</i> application.  When the meter is running it consumes credits and grants internet access (5) to the child’s devices (4).
		When the meter is not running the child can only reach the external <i>Credit-Feeder</i> website (3), or any other whitelisted sites.
		Parents (6) subscribe to the platform because it provides them the valuable capability to ensure that their children have incentive to make a
		strong effort when performing activities.
		In turn, free education software developers (8) have incentive (7) to compete for those subscription fees, distributed by the parent-subscribers, themselves.
		This can stimulate new innovations in free education software.
